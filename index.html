            <h2>WELCOME</h2>
            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Pour Taste! The app that helps you host a flawless blind wine tasting party.
                Let us take the math out of the equation so you can sit back, relax, and worry about the snacks. 
            </p>
            <h3>SET UP YOUR PARTY</h3>
                <p>
                    Log in and create a new party.
                    Ask each guest to bring two bottles of the same wine
                    in a bag so no one else can see what they've brought.
                    For each wine, put one in a paper bag for party tasting and
                    set one aside as a prize for the winner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend you ask guests to all bring the same type of wine (red, white, sparking) for tasting.
                    If you're feeling wild, you can leave it open to any type. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go to your party page and add each bottle wine to your party.
                    The app will assign a letter to the wine.
                    Write this letter on the outside of the paper bag of the wine.
                    It is best to wait until all guests have arrived so you can mix up the order of the tastings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As your guests arrive direct them to the app and have them join your party using the instructions below 
                    by giving your party ID (located on your party page).
                </p>
            <h3>JOIN A PARTY</h3>
                <p>
                    Click Ask your host for their party ID. Log in and click join party.
                    Once the host has added the wines to the party, new tastings will appear.
                </p>
            <h3>TIME TO TASTE</h3>
                <p>
                    Grab the glasses and set out the brie, it's time to taste!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have each guest pour about one ounce of wine per tasting.
                    Each guest should then rate the wines on a scale of one (nasty sauce) to ten (angle tears in your mouth)
                    Hosts can rate wines too, but to prevent you from tipping the scales on scores, your ratings don't count
                    in the final tally. 
                </p>
            <h3>FIND WINNER</h3>
                <p>
                    Once all the tasting is complete, it's time to find the most highly rated wine!
                    Go to your party page and click total scores. This will close your party for tasting, 
                    so make sure everyon is finished! (If you do find stragglers, you can open the party again via your party page.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The winner will be the wine with the highest average rating, but you'll see the scores for all the wines,
                    just in case you want to split the prize wine among second and third place too.
                    Or be ruthless and let the winner take all!
